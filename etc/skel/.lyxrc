# BIND SECTION ###########################################################
#

# Before defining your own bindings, select one of the available default
# binding sets. These are resource files (like this one) that define a
# large set of (keyboard) bindings. These files live in bind directory of
# the LyX system directory and have the .bind suffix.
# Currently, you can choose from the following flavors:
#
# pc-modern.bind      for Windows-, Mac- and Motif-like bindings
# emacs.bind          for Emacs-like bindings.
#
# The \bind_file command looks in the LyX bind directory for a file 
# of the given name, so a full path should not be given.

\bind_file pc-modern.bind
#\bind_file emacs.bind

# Based on the default, you can now change part or all of it with the
# \bind command. For example, when you want the delete key to do the
# backspace action, uncomment the following line:

#\bind "Delete" "delete-backward"

# However, when you're not (totally) happy with the default bindings, 
# the most logical thing to do would be to copy the user space area 
# from one of the .bind files into your $HOME/.lyxrc file and change 
# it to your needs.

# <Place optional user-space bindings right here>

# Finally, when you want to change more that just the user space bindings,
# which is perfectly alright, copy one of the .bind files from the LyX
# bind directory to a new file in your account and change it. Uncomment
# the following line and change the file name argument. Make sure it's an
# absolute pathname.

#\bind_file /some/path/to/mybindfile

# Based on how much you redefine, you may want to disable all of the other
# bind stuff above by simply commenting it out.


#
# MISC SECTION ###########################################################
#

# Set to false if you don't want the current selection to be replaced
# automatically by what you type. Default is true.
#\auto_region_delete true

# This is the time interval between autosaves (in seconds).
# 0 means no autosave, default is 300 for five minutes.
#\autosave 300

# If you want to use further options for the previewer xdvi insert them here.
# You don't need to specify the papersize and orientation. This is done
# automatically by LyX.
# Example: the next line would make xdvi display with shrink 2:
#\xdvi_extra_options -s 2 

# If you want to pass extra flags to the LinuxDoc sgml scripts, insert them
# here. 
# Example: the next line activates iso-latin1 support:
#\sgml_extra_options -l

# Keyboard Mapping. Use this to set the correct mapping file for your
# keyboard, that is if you need one.
#\kbmap false
#\kbmap_primary default
#\kbmap_secondary default

#
# SCREEN & FONTS SECTION #################################################
#

# The screen fonts used to display the LaTeX fonts.
# The defaults are:
#\roman_font -*-utopia
#\sans_font -*-helvetica
#\typewriter_font -*-courier

# The norm for the screen fonts. The default is iso8859-1.
#\font_norm iso8859-1

# The normal fontsize on the screen. The default is 14.
#\normal_fontsize 14

# If you use 1024x768 resolution, you might like 20 better:
#\normal_fontsize 20

# The font sizes used for calculating the scaling of the screen fonts.
# If the third value is exactly the value of \normal_fontsize these values
# will be used as they are. (See formula below). The format is:
#\fontsizes <tiny> <small> <normal> <large> <larger> <largest> <huge> <giant>

# This is the default in LyX (what LaTeX does):
#\fontsizes 8  9 10 12 14 17 20 25

# This may be better for your X11R4 server:
#\fontsizes 8 11 14 17 20 25 30 34

# The screen font size for text of size TextSize is calculated using 
# this formula:
#    fontsizes[TextSize]*normal_fontsize / fontsizes[normal]
# I.e. using the defaults, the screen size of tiny text is (8 * 14) / 10 = 11.


#
# TOOLBAR SECTION ########################################################
#

# Setup your favourite Toolbar here:
# Only one command is allowed inside the begin_toolbar and end_toolbar
# directives: \add. \add has this format:
# \add <action> [<parameter>]
#
# Examples:
#\add font-size small
#\add set-emph
#
# These actions are well supported at the moment (i.e. have icons):
#   buffer-open, buffer-close, buffer-print, font-emph, font-smallcaps,
#   font-free, footnote-insert, depth-next, cut, paste, tex-mode,
#   math-mode-old (obsolete), math-mode, marginpar-insert, table-insert,
#   melt, lyx-quit, math-insert [parameter], symbol_insert [parameter]
# These actions are special for the toolbar:
#   tool-layouts for a combobox for style selection
#   tool-seperator for a small space between icons
#
# This is the default toolbar:
#\begin_toolbar
#\add tool-layouts
#\add buffer-open
#\add buffer-close
#\add buffer-print
#\add font-emph
#\add font-smallcaps
#\add font-free
#\add footnote-insert
#\add depth-next
#\add cut
#\add paste
#\add tex-mode
#\add math-mode
#\add marginpar-insert
#\add figure-insert
#\add table-insert
#\add melt
#\end_toolbar


#
# PRINTER SECTION ########################################################
#

# The default printer to print on.
#\printer lp

# If you don't use dvips, you may specify your favourite print program here.
#\print_command dvips

# These specify the options to pass to the printer program to select the
# corresponding features. These default to the options used for the dvips
# program. Look at the manpage for your favourite print program to learn
# which options to use.
# Normally you don't need to change this unless you use something other
# than dvips. 
#\print_evenpage_flag -B
#\print_oddpage_flag -A
#\print_reverse_flag -r 
#\print_landscape_flag -t landscape

# Option to pass to the print program to print on a specific printer.
#\print_to_printer -P

# Option to pass to the print program to print to a file.
#\print_to_file -o

# Extension of printer program output file. Usually .ps
#\print_file_extension .ps

# Extra options to pass to printing program after everything 
# else, but before the filename of the DVI file to be printed.
#\print_extra_options

# When set, this printer option automatically prints to a file 
# and then calls a separate print spooling program on that file
# with the given name and arguments.
# Use this if dvips can't print to your printer.
# Special rule: if you specify a printer name in the print dialog,
# the option for printing to a specific printer (\print_to_printer)
# is appended along with the printer name after the spool command.
#\print_spool_cmd


#
# TEX SECTION  ###########################################################
#

# If your system does not use the command "latex" to invoke LaTeX(2e), you
# can specify another command here.
# Example: the next line uses latex2e to start LaTeX:
#\latex_command latex2e

# T1 is highly recommended for non-english languages.

# Choose "default" if T1 doesn't work for you for some reason:
#\fontencoding default

# The inputencoding used for the LaTeX2e inputenc package
#\inputencoding latin1

# Enter your favorite LaTeX-commands in the preamble:
#\begin_preamble

# Shall LaTeX allow accent marks above _all_ chars? (true or false)
# Default is false.
#\allow_accents false

# If you don't want to use postscript figures set this to `none'
# else use one of these drivers: dvips, dvitops, emtex, ln, oztex,
