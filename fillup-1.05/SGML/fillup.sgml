<sect>NAME
<p>      

	<bf/fillup/ - fill one configuration file into another

      
<sect>SYNOPSIS
<p>      

             <bf/fillup/ [options] basefile additionalfile
<p>
             Options:  
<p>	     <tt/[-heqstvV] [-d char] [-c char] [-o filename]/

      
<sect>DESCRIPTION
<p>      

	This manual page documents the S.u.S.E. program <bf/fillup/.
	<bf/fillup/ takes at least 2 arguments: a basefile and a newfile.
	Both of them contain e.g. configuration information expressed 
	by e.g. environment variables consisting of a variable name, 
	an assignment delimitor and a variable value.
	<bf/fillup/ reads both files and looks up wether variables in the new file
	are not contained in the basefile. New variables are appended to the basefile
	including comments preceeding the variable definition, the variable name, 
	the assignment delimitor and the variables value. Anything between two 
        variable statements is understood as comment even if not introduced by a
        comment marker.
	Logical lines connected by `\\' are copied as one line. No characters may follow
        the line connector except white space or new line chars. 

	The default delimitor is `=', the default comment marker is `&num'. Both may 
	be altered by command line options. 

	While processing the files, <bf/fillup/ will display the name of every new 
	variable found in newfile. If <bf/fillup/ finds duplicate variables in the
	basefile and the newfile, it will issue a warning.

        The strict parsing behaviour of <bf/fillup/ concerning the end of file condition
        may be released by using the <tt/-e/ option.

<sect>OPTIONS
<p>

<descrip>
<tag/-c char, --char char/      
		use char as comment marker instead of default comment 
		marker `#'.
	         
	<p>
<tag/-d char, --delim char/      
		use char as assignment delimitor instead of the default
		delimitor `='.
  
        <p>
<tag/-e, --ignoreeof/
		ignore eof where it would not be allowed otherwise (i.e. in
		variable names or in variable values).

	<p>
<tag/-h, --help/    	         
		help: display a short message how to use <bf/fillup/.

	<p>
<tag/-o filename, --output filename/
		do not append output to basefile but write output to filename 
                instead. Previous contents of filename will be deleted!
		
        <p>
<tag/-q, --quiet/
		quiet: no output to screen except errors and warnings.
	
	<p>
<tag/-s, --suppress/
		suppress comments: do not copy the comments contained
		in newfile to the target file, but only variables and
                their values.

        <p>
<tag/-t, --trailing/
                If there are comment lines at the end of the read file which are not 
                followed by a variable statement (kind of premature end of file),
                then transfer that comment to outfile anyway 

        <p>
<tag/-v, --verbose/
		display any new variable on the screen while processing 
                including assignment delimitor and variable value (stdout may 
                be redirected)

<p>
<tag/-V, --version/
                print the version of this <bf/fillup/ binary and exit with code 0.
<p>
</descrip>

<sect>EXIT CODE
<p>
	<bf/fillup/ returns -1 on any error.
        on successful completion, <bf/fillup/ returns the (non-negative) number of 
        new variable lines added / written to the output file.


<sect>HINT
<p>
Use -t -d ":" for /etc/passwd or /etc/groups<p>
Use -d "=" for shell scripts (default)<p>
To prevent the shell of interpreting your specified delimitor or comment marker 
you better quote those characters as in the examples!
