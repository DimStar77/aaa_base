<sect>DESCRIPTION
<p>      
This page documents the SuSE program '<bf/fillup/'.
<bf/fillup/ - merges input files into one resulting output
file. Each file normally is a configuration file.

<bf/fillup/ merges files which are holding variables
(ie configuration or environment variables).
A variable is defined by an entity composed of a
preceeding comment, a variable name, an assignment
delimiter and related variable value.

A preceeding comment may be optional.
An assignment delimiter may be optional, but if there is
an assignment delimiter, a variable name must preceed.
The last entity may be composed only of a comment.

Only if variables - which are determined by its variable
names - are included in both input files this fact has
an effect on the functionality of <bf/fillup/.
Otherwise, variables which are included only in one of
the input files are added to the resulting output file,
(with the exception of the -i|--ignoreDefinites option).

The functionality is now controlled by a parameter which
determines whether a double included variable is taken
from the basefile or from the addfile.
Furthermore a parameter controls whether the variable
is removed from a copy of basefile.

To keep the <bf/fillup/ v1.04 functionality, the outputfile
parameter can be omitted -- this means the resulting
output file is named exactly like the first input file
name (basefile = outputfile).


<sect>EXAMPLES
<p>
<bf/fillup/ -m "/etc/rc.config" "my.config" "/etc/rc.config"

All variables of "/etc/rc.config" are passed to the
resulting output file "/etc/rc.config".
Only within "my.config" defined variables are appended.


<bf/fillup/ -exchange "/etc/rc.config" "my.config"

Only variables of "/etc/rc.config" that are not also defined
within "my.config" are passed to the resulting output file
"/etc/rc.config"
All variables of "my.config" are appended.


<bf/fillup/ -m -r "/etc/rc.config" "my.config" "/etc/rc.config"

All variables of "/etc/rc.config" are passed to the
resulting output file "/etc/rc.config".
Only within "my.config" defined variables are appended.
The additional parameter '-r' causes that double defined
variables are removed from a copy of "/etc/rc.config".


<bf/fillup/ -i "/etc/rc.config" "my.config"

This is a filter functionality. Only variables of
"/etc/rc.config" are passed to the resulting output file
"/etc/rc.config" only if they are defined in both input files.
Because "my.config" is normally only a list of variable names,
this is a filter functionality.


<sect>OPTIONS
<p>
There are many options, which are displayed if <bf/fillup/ is called
without or with the -h|--help parameter.

Most of the parameters are based on v1.04. Next only the
usefull parameters are listed:

<verb>
   -i, --ignoreDefinites    don't write variables to the output    
                            if they are only defined in basefile   
   -t, --trailing           save trailing comments at end of file  
   -v, --verbose            maximum output to screen               
   -V, --version            print <bf/fillup/ version and exit     
   -c | --char <char>       use <char> as comment marker 
   -d | --delim <char>      use <char> as delimiter    
   -m, --maintain           check for maintaining the basefile     
   -x, --exchange           check for exchange                     
   -r, --remove             check for removal within basefile      
</verb>

<sect>EXIT CODE
<p>
<bf/fillup/ returns EXIT_SUCCESS on successful completion.
Otherwise an exception handler is called, which may return
EXIT_FAILURE.


<sect>BUGS
<p>
If a bug is occuring which isn't based on invalid options or
missing input files, please add the option -v|--verbose to the
call. The result and some classificationis are displayed to
locate the bug.
