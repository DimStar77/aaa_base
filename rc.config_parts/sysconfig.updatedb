# Should updatedb (for locate) be started by cron.daily ("yes" or "no")

RUN_UPDATEDB=yes

#
# updatedb has a parameter "--localuser".
# It runs the "find" command as this user. Some people think this is a
# security hole if set to 'root' (because some directory information can
# be read which is normally protected). Others think it is useful to hold
# all files in the database.
# So if you want full information in locate db, set RUN_UPDATEDB_AS=root.
# If you want security use RUN_UPDATEDB_AS=nobody.

RUN_UPDATEDB_AS=nobody

#
# uptdatedb normally only scans local harddisks, but can include net paths
# in the database as well. If you specify directories here, they will be
# scanned.

# uptdatedb can skip directories for its database. The following parameter
# says which ones.

UPDATEDB_NETUSER=""

#
# updatedb can skip certain filesystem types completely
# this sets the parameter "--prunefs" for updatedb
