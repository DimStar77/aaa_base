## Path:	System/Kernel
## Description:
## Type:	string
## Command:     /sbin/mkinitrd
#
# This variable contains the list of modules to be added to the initial
# ramdisk by calling the script "mk_initrd"
# (like drivers for scsi-controllers, for lvm or reiserfs)
#
INITRD_MODULES=""

## Type:		string
## ServiceRestart:	boot.loadmodules
#
# This variable contains the list of modules to be loaded
# once the main filesystem is active
# You will find a few default modules for hardware which
# can not be detected automatically.
#
MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT="capability raw1394 video1394"

## Type:        string
## Default:     ""
#
# The file name of a binary ACPI Differentiated System Description Table
# (DSDT). This table is appended to the initial ram disk (initrd) that
# the mkinitrd script creates. If the kernel finds that its initrd
# contains a DSDT, this table replaces the DSDT of the bios. If the file
# specified in ACPI_DSDT is not found or ACPI_DSDT is empty/not specified,
# no DSDT will be appended to the initrd.
# Example path /etc/acpi/dsdt
#
ACPI_DSDT=""

## Type:	integer
#
# Size parameter for mounting the tmpfs/shmfs filesystem. The kernel defaults
# to 50% of the available RAM size, but this might not be enough for
# some special setups.
#
SHMFS_SIZE=""

## Type:	string
## Default:     ""
#
# other options for mounting shmfs
#
SHMFS_OPTIONS=""

## Type:	integer(1000:50000)
## Default:	1000
#
# Length of the shortest timeslice a process (with lowest priority / maximum 
# niceness) will be running on a CPU. Time is given in microseconds (us).
# This time should be much shorter than SCHED_MAXTIMESLICE to keep the
# nice values meaningful. The values can only be specified up to a accuracy
# of 1/HZ s, i.e. 10000us on a HZ=100 system, 1000us if HZ=1000.
# Note that the boot script (boot.sched) does scale the values if the 
# MINTIMESLICE is below the minimum for the timer interrupt frequency (HZ 
# value) of the booted kernel.
# For interactive desktop use, SCHED_MINTIMESLICE/SCHED_MAXTIMESLICE values
# of 1000 and 30000 are recommended. For non-interactive use, multiply both
# values by 10 or 20.
# 
SCHED_MINTIMESLICE=""

## Type:	integer(20000:1000000)
## Default:	40000
#
# Length of the longest timeslice a process (with highest priority / minimum
# niceness) will be running on a CPU. Time is given in microseconds (us).
# This time should be much longer than SCHED_MINTIMESLICE to keep the
# nice values meaningful. (The boot.sched script will not accept the value
# if there's less than a factor of three in between them, default is 30.)
# For interactive desktop use, SCHED_MINTIMESLICE/SCHED_MAXTIMESLICE values
# of 1000 and 30000 are recommended. For non-interactive use, multiply both
# values by 10 or 20.

SCHED_MAXTIMESLICE=""

## Type:	string(yes)
