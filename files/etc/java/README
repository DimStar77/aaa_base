Dear customer,

The SuSE Linux distribution contains several versions of development
kits for developing and running java applications and several versions 
of runtime environments only for running java applications.

To be able to run java applications which need different versions of
runtime environment or development kit, you may install several
versions at the same time. One of these development kits or runtime
environments is always the default while the other versions can be used
to develope or run particular applications.

Note: In the next text JDK stands for java development kit and JRE for
      java runtime environment.



The directory /etc/java contains configuration files for all installed
JDK's and JRE's.

These configuration files are used by SuSEconfig and  setDefaultJava
scripts which will help you to set default JDK or JRE on your computer.

They are also used by script setJava which will help you to use one of
valid versions of JDK's or JRE's with your application.


Syntax of configuration files:
------------------------------
1. empty lines are ignored
2. white characters are ignored (spaces, TABs)
3. comments are ignored, they are prefixed by hash '#'
4. Parametrs and values are delimited by ':' or '='

Available parametrs in config files (see the example config file below):
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Priority:
    - value is an integer
    - the JDK or JRE with higher priority is selected when there are more
      JDKs or JREs acceptable for given parametres in the scripts setJava and
      setDefaultJava
    - a lower value defines higher priority
    
Vendor:
    - value is a string (spaces are allowed)
    - defines java vendor name
    
Version:
    - value is composed of integers delimited by dots
    - defines JDK or JRE version
    
Devel:
    - value is either "True" or "False"
    - value "True" defines that this java is JDK
        
JAVA_BINDIR:
    - value is a path to a directory
    - defines the path to java executables
    - will be used for PATH and JAVA_BINDIR environment variables
      
JAVA_ROOT:
    - value is a path to a directory
    - defines the path to the java root dir
    - is exactly the same for the JDK and the JRE of the same version
      and vendor
    - will be used for JAVA_ROOTDIR environment variable

JAVA_HOME:
    - value is path to directory
    - some applications use this value to find java executables
      in $JAVA_HOME/bin
    - the value is usually different for JDK and JRE of the same version
      and vendor
    - will be used for JAVA_HOME environment variable
      
JRE_HOME:
    - value is a path to a directory
    - some applications use this value to search for java executables and
      libraries in $JAVA_JRE/bin and $JAVA_JRE/lib
    - the value is the same for the JDK and the JRE of the same version
      and vendor
    - will be used for JRE_HOME environment variable

JDK_HOME:
    - value is a path to a directory
    - it is added as supplement to JRE_HOME
    - it is defined for all JDKs
    - will be used for JDK_HOME environment variable

SDK_HOME:
    - value is a path to a directory
    - it is added as supplement to JRE_HOME
    - it is defined for JDKs with version 1.2 and higher
    - will be used for SDK_HOME environment variable

JAVA_LINK
    - value is a absolute or relative path to a direcotry
    - it is used by script setDefaultJava and SuSEconfig,
    - the link /usr/lib/java and other compatibility links will point
      to this direcory name or to this path
      
      
Example:
# this is configutation file for JRE from Sun Microsystems, version 1.3.1
# it is installed in /usr/lib/SunJava2-1.3.1

Priority : 30

Vendor   : Sun
Version  : 1.3.1
Devel    : False

JAVA_BINDIR = /usr/lib/SunJava2-1.3.1/jre/bin
JAVA_ROOT   = /usr/lib/SunJava2-1.3.1
JAVA_HOME   = /usr/lib/SunJava2-1.3.1/jre
JRE_HOME    = /usr/lib/SunJava2-1.3.1/jre
JDK_HOME    =
SDK_HOME    =

JAVA_LINK   = SunJava2-1.3.1


Have a lot of fun,
