   Boot logging
   ============

This small package provides a daemon for for
logging during boot time of System V boot.

The syntax is simple:

   pid=`blogd`

   [...fiddeling, mount fs rw ...]

   # BOOT_LOGFILE
   dmesg > /var/log/boot.msg
   echo $pid > /var/run/blogd.pid

   [...fiddeling...]

   killproc /sbin/blogd

Happy booting,
